Prerequisite

- Elasticsearch 1.1.0 or higher


Steps
-----

Install the Appropriate Client Submodule
----------------------------------------

Search API Elasticsearch supports the ability to choose which client library
you would like to use. Currently, the only client submodule included is for
Elastica. Follow the instructions in the appropriate submodule's INSTALL.txt.

Set up elasticsearch
--------------------

Read the elasticsearch documentation at [2] and tutorials at [3].

Make sure you have enough file descriptors and that server host and port
match the ones defined in the Search API elasticsearch server configuration.

Ideally, set up a new user to run elasticsearch as a non-root user. See [4].
